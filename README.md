## Project Setup

To set up the project, follow these steps:

1. Initialize a new React project named NewsProfileApp.
2. Install React Router for managing navigation between pages.
3. Choose a CSS framework like Bootstrap or Tailwind CSS for styling.

## INSTALLATION

1. npm install react-router-dom (for react-router)
2. npm install react-bootstrap@latest ('import 'bootstrap/dist/css/bootstrap.min.css'' - include this in the .js file)
3. npm install react-icons


## Profile Page Design

### User Information Section
Display the user's avatar, name, and a short bio using appropriate HTML elements and CSS classes for styling.

### Tabs for Content Organization
Implement tabs or segmented controls to separate the user's posted news articles and their bookmarked/liked stories. Use React Router for page navigation or a tab component from a CSS framework.

### News Cards
For each article under the posted and bookmarked sections, display a card with the article's title, an excerpt, and a thumbnail image. Use appropriate HTML and CSS for the card layout.

### Settings Icon
Include an icon that navigates to a settings page (the settings page implementation is beyond this assignment's scope but prepare the navigation).

## Functionality

### Navigation
Use React Router to move between the profile page and other dummy pages (e.g., a home page and a settings page) to demonstrate navigation capability.

### Mock Data
Use static data to represent the user information and articles. Create a JSON file with dummy data that includes user information and a list of articles.

## Styling

### CSS Styling
Use CSS to style your application, including layout, colours, typography, etc.

### Customization
Customize the appearance of your tabs and cards to mimic a modern news application. You may choose a colour scheme that suits a new context.
